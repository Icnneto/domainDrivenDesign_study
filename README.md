# Domain-Driven Design

This repository provides a structured overview of **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, from fundamental concepts to more advanced topics. 
The goal is to create a concise and practical personal reference, and also to help others developers to understand and apply DDD principles effectively.

## Introduction to DDD
Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development philosophy that emphasizes the importance of understanding and modeling the business domain. 
It is a strategy aimed at improving the quality of software by aligning it more closely with the business needs it serves.

First introduced by `Eric Evans in his 2003 book "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software"`, 
DDD provides a collection of principles and patterns that help developers craft elegant object systems. 
At its core, DDD navigates complexity by focusing software development on the 'domain'—the specific business context within which the software operates.

A key concept in DDD is the 'ubiquitous language'—a common language shared by both developers and business stakeholders. 
This shared vocabulary ensures that software accurately reflects the business domain it serves, effectively closing the gap between business reality and code.

When properly applied, DDD leads to software abstractions called domain models that encapsulate complex business logic. 
These models serve as a bridge between technical implementation and business requirements, resulting in systems that are not only technically sound but also meaningful from a business perspective.

## Domains and Subdomains - What are they?

### Domains
In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), the domain represents the sphere of knowledge, influence, or activity around which the application is built. It's not just the business core, but encompasses the problems the business is trying to solve, the specialized knowledge the business has developed, and the language experts use when discussing these problems.

"In Domain-Driven Design, the 'domain' represents the specific business problem space and associated knowledge that the software aims to address. It encapsulates the core business concepts, rules, processes, and relationships that define the organization's area of expertise. The domain is the 'why' behind the software's existence and provides the shared language (ubiquitous language) that connects technical implementation to business reality. Without a clear understanding of the domain, software risks becoming disconnected from the actual business needs it intends to serve."
Key aspects that strengthen this definition:

The domain includes both the problem space and the specialized knowledge
- It emphasizes that domain knowledge exists independently of software
- It highlights the importance of the ubiquitous language that bridges technical and business concerns
- It acknowledges that the domain provides context and meaning for all technical decisions
